        "intro": "The 2007 Honda S2000, affectionately named \"Hyperion\", is a car built for both street and track use. Drawing inspiration from the virtual \"AP2 - Legendary\" S2000 in Assetto Corsa, it strives to reach new heights, much like its namesake tree. As development progresses, \"Hyperion\" is set to evolve into the ideal GT race car, combining performance and precision.<br><br>This car has had two previous owners, neither of whom treated it with the care it deserved. The vehicle was lowered without proper supporting modifications, such as RCAs and a bump steer kit. The cheap suspension components used in the setup also put strain on the underbody, damaging crucial parts like the CV axle, header, and catalytic converter. Additionally, the car was involved in a front-end collision, resulting in the loss of three VINs, leaving only seven intact.<br><br>Despite its past, \"Hyperion\" is on a path of rejuvenation and improvement, continuing to push towards its full potential as a track-ready machine.",

Finished in Berlina Black, this roadster exudes timeless elegance and delivers an unmatched driving experience. Its journey with me began in Missouri, where it joined my life in excellent condition, aside from a worn clutch. Even with that minor flaw, RH carried me across the country to Southern California without missing a beat. A highlight of the trip was its stop at the Grand Canyon, where its black silhouette stood out against the breathtaking landscape. Now thriving in California, RH lives for the open road. Whether cruising with the top down or unleashing its legendary high-revving engine, this S2000 is a celebration of precision, freedom, and pure driving joy.",
